This `auth_api` package provides a concrete API implementation of the `AuthClient` interface (defined in `package:auth_client`) within the [**Flutter News App Full Source Code Toolkit**](https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code). It encapsulates the logic for interacting with a backend authentication service via HTTP requests, leveraging `package:http_client` for underlying communication and standardized error handling. This package is crucial for applications that need to connect to a remote authentication service, ensuring consistent and robust authentication mechanisms across the Flutter mobile app, web dashboard, and Dart Frog backend API.

## ‚≠ê Feature Showcase: Robust Backend Authentication Integration

This package offers a comprehensive set of features for integrating with a backend authentication service.

<summary><strong>üß± Core Functionality</strong></summary>

### üöÄ `AuthClient` Implementation
- **`AuthApi` Class:** A concrete implementation of the `AuthClient` interface, providing a standardized way to interact with a remote authentication service.
- **HTTP-Based Communication:** Utilizes `package:http_client` for making HTTP requests to the backend authentication service.

### üîê Authentication Flows
- **`requestSignInCode`:** Initiates the process of requesting a sign-in code via email.
- **`verifySignInCode`:** Verifies the sign-in code to complete the authentication process.
- **`signInAnonymously`:** Allows users to sign in anonymously, creating a temporary user identity on the backend.
- **`getCurrentUser`:** Retrieves the currently authenticated user's details from the backend.
- **`authStateChanges` Stream:** Provides a stream for monitoring real-time authentication state changes.
- **`signOut`:** Handles signing out the current user from the backend.

### üõ°Ô∏è Standardized Error Handling
- **`HttpException` Propagation:** Propagates standardized `HttpException` errors (from `core`) from the underlying `http_client`, ensuring consistent and predictable error management across the application layers.

### üíâ Dependency Injection Ready
- **`HttpClient` Dependency:** Requires a configured `HttpClient` instance (from `package:http_client`) via its constructor, promoting loose coupling and testability.

> **üí° Your Advantage:** This package provides a robust and production-ready API client for backend authentication. It simplifies the integration of remote authentication services, leverages standardized error handling, and ensures consistent authentication flows across your application ecosystem.
